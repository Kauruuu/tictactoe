Certainly! Here's the updated description reflecting your work on the Tic-Tac-Toe web application:

To build this Tic-Tac-Toe web application, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging game. The HTML structure defines the game board as a 3x3 grid, with each cell available for user interaction.

With CSS, I styled the game to ensure the board is visually appealing and responsive. The cells are clearly marked with "X" and "O", and hover effects are applied to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I used CSS to display messages when the game ends, indicating whether a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.

In JavaScript, I implemented the core logic to handle:

User clicks: Each player takes turns by clicking on the cells to place their respective markers ("X" or "O").
Game state management: I tracked the state of each cell in an array, ensuring each move is recorded and the game progresses properly.
Winning conditions: I checked if a player has won by getting three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Game reset: I added functionality to reset the game and start fresh whenever needed.
The game provides real-time feedback on whose turn it is and displays a message when a player wins or when there's a draw. This application is designed to be fully interactive, allowing users to play against each other with an intuitive interface.
